    "problem": "Current Mission Control UI needs to match the new design specification provided by Logan. The UI must be fully functional with real data from our APIs, not placeholders.",
    "scope": "Update src/pages/MissionControl.tsx to implement the new design with:\n- Agent status strip (compact/expanded modes based on active agents)\n- Kanban columns (proposed, queued, development, review, done)\n- Blocked tasks bar (collapsible)\n- Activity feed sidebar\n- Task cards with priority dots, tags, and owner indicators\n- Real-time data from /api/tasks, /api/agents, /api/live, /api/activity\n- DM Sans font from Google Fonts\n- Exact colors and styling from reference file",
    "acceptanceCriteria": [
      "Agent strip shows expanded cards when <4 active, compact mode when >=4 active",
      "All data comes from real API endpoints (no mock data)",
      "Task cards show priority (P0/P1/P2/P3) with correct colors",
      "Task cards show tags (Epic, UI, Backend, QA, etc.) with correct colors",
      "Blocked tasks bar is collapsible and shows all blocked tasks",
      "Activity feed shows recent events from /api/activity",
      "Navigation bar matches design (Mission Control, Projects, Activity, etc.)",
      "Board header shows total tasks, critical count, blocked count",
      "+ New task button is functional",
      "Column overflow shows +N more button when >5 tasks",
      "All styling matches reference file exactly (colors, spacing, borders, shadows)",
      "Code pushed to GitHub and Docker container updated"
