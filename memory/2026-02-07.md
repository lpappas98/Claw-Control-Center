- Logan introduced themselves.
- Logan wants to call the assistant “TARS” (Interstellar).
- Vibe: play it by ear.
- Hard boundaries: do not send emails/messages to others unless explicitly instructed; never spend money without asking.
- Logan asked to implement a token-optimization guide (lean session init, tool discipline, etc.).
- Logan shared an account password in chat; I will not store/use it and recommended changing it.
